    <main>
        <p>I began my programming journey later than others. I discovered my love for 
            technology and, more specifically, programming as I was applying to medical schools.
            Thus, I made a decision to commit head-on into a big career path change.
            I am fully committed to my transition and I am confident in my abilities and my passion.

            I also enjoy playing sports like soccer, football, and pickleball. I enjoy reading. And I love traveling.
